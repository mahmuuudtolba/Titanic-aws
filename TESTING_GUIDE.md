# ðŸ§ª Simple Testing Guide

This guide will help you understand testing step by step.

## What is Testing?

Testing is like checking if your code works correctly. Think of it like:
- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual pieces (like testing if a function works)
- **Integration Tests**: Testing how pieces work together
- **Application Tests**: Testing the whole application

## Quick Start

### 1. Run Simple Tests
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

### 2. Run Specific Tests
```bash
# Run all simple tests
pytest tests/test_overall.py -v

```

### 3. See Available Tests
```bash
python run_tests.py --list
```
